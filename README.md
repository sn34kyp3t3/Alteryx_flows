We create next generation technologies, tools, and products to unleash the full potential of machine learning. Our mission is to turbo-charge machine learning and data science efforts by creating open source projects that form the foundation of ML capability within the [Alteryx Platform](https://www.alteryx.com).

### Libraries

We currently have four Python libraries available for machine learning aficionados to use. 

- [Featuretools](https://github.com/alteryx/featuretools) automates the feature engineering process
- [EvalML](https://github.com/alteryx/evalml) automates model building, includes data checks, and even offers tools for model understanding
- [Compose](https://github.com/alteryx/compose) automates prediction engineering
- [Woodwork](https://github.com/alteryx/woodwork) standarizes data typing across all of our libaries

### Blog Posts

The Alteryx Open Source team also shares strategies for making the most of these libraries and insights they’ve learned along the way on the [Innovation Labs blog](https://innovation.alteryx.com/). Some recent posts include:
